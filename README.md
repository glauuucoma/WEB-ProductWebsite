<h1>Assignment 5-6 Overview:</h1>

The primary focus of Assignment 5 was to design and develop a multi-page website featuring courses, a form page, and other relevant content. I practiced building complex HTML and CSS layouts while incorporating JavaScript functionalities. The main web page (index.html) showcases product cards displaying information about different courses, designed using <strong>Flexbox</strong>. The assignment emphasized creativity while adhering to ethical coding practices and image usage guidelines.

I extended the existing website from Assignment 5, incorporating additional HTML5 web pages with style sheets and JavaScript. Two new pages were created, one of them hosts a form allowing users/suppliers to input and submit product-related information with JavaScript validation. 'reflection.html' contains a reflective write-up addressing concepts like responsive design, web technologies, and personal learning experiences from the course.
